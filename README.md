# Evim - A vim style terminal based text editor

Hi! This is my first bigger project in C. My goal is to make, as the title says, a vim style terminal based text editor in C. I'm also implementing some vim commands. 

The base of the editor is based on this (https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) tutorial.
